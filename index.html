        <p> Social media management is a recent role that's a part of New Media. It's used as a marketing tool to collect data and target specific users. They interact with the content leading to the organization's marketing goals. A person or company discusses their performance goals with a social media manager, and insight into the brand is done to learn more about engagement and the company's social media presence. Social media is an ever-evolving tool where brands must stay on top of trends and engage with their audience. It's necessary for brands to have a presence on multiple social media platforms at once and to post content regularly. Brands must monitor conversations, respond to comments, implement automation tools, and build campaigns to maximize reach and engagement. This blog will explore how brands can better manage their social media presence by using these strategies.</p>
