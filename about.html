    <h2>Meet Martisha Woodruff</h2>
    <p>Music has always been a part of my life growing up in Detroit, Michigan.From the Motown records from my parents to the lively radio stations hosts, which sparked my interest in audio and editing. As someone who spent time on social media, I learned about HTML and CSS through Tumblr as a teenager. It has been an invaluable tool in familiarizing me with designing web pages and pairing previous understanding with current learning.</p>
    <p>Graduating with a Media and Information degree can be exciting and daunting. As a student, I am challenged to decide which career path to take. In this blog, I will explore my journey as I make this important decision. From researching different job opportunities to learning how to use new technologies, I will share my experiences and insights as I navigate my way through the ever-changing world of media.
    Media roles have been affected by changes in technology and the challenges of transitioning to new positions. The blog will also discuss some of the significant design careers available in this field and how they are helping shape its future.</p>
